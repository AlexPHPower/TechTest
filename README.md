In order for this tech test to run you will need to run migrations to create the required tables.

I have created a test to check that the homepage runs correctly. I would have liked to also create
a test to ensure the file uploader works however I ran out of time.
 I would have used the csv file I placed in the storage folder to run through the route and ensure the names are outputted on the page.
